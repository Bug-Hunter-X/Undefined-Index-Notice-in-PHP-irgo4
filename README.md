This repository demonstrates a common PHP error: the "Undefined index" notice.  The `bug.php` file contains code that attempts to access an array element using a non-existent key. This results in a notice-level error, which, while not halting execution, can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug problems in larger applications.  The `bugSolution.php` provides a solution demonstrating how to safely access array elements using isset() or ?? to prevent the error.
